This mod saves you some time by showing it right inside the mission selection dialog.

Based on your current career the frames around all mission icons will represent the highest difficulty you beat so far (instead of the highest difficulty of ANY career)
It will also affect the banners and trophy room decorations when entering the keep. (Currently not reloading when changing careers. You can enforce reloading by going back to the main menu and enter the keep again - will address this in future updates)
Even DLC maps can be tracked now.";
